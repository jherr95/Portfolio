                <p style="text-align: center">This fine esablishment was founded by a group of college kids that while in school realized the lack of, personal and social,<br />time spent in the kitchen. They quickly developed a cooking acadamy that transended their dream in school and this lead them down the<br />next logical path after school which was to open up a restaurant. The very first Jay Boys Cooking restaurant opened just 6 monthes after<br />they graduated. It is a unique spot not just because of their wildly creative menu and inviting and infectious attmosphere, but also the<br />experience where you can join in the action heating up in the kitchen. This has quickly become the hottest spot in the area...<br />Especially for date nights!</p>
